        <p class="card-description">
          I enjoy spending my free time with my friends no matter what the
          activity is. Listening to their perspective while chatting or hiking
          on a sunny day.

        <p class="card-description">
          Travelling and exploring new places has always been exciting for me as
          it allows to meet with new people, learn about their culture. I am so
          lucky that I have a soulmate who also loves travelling. <3

        <p class="card-description">
          Music, specifically my classical guitar, has been a part of my life
          since primary school. Recently, I have bought a spanish guitar that I
          have always dreamed of. I am really enjoying it. :)

          In this picture, you are looking at the younger version of myself in
          2008 at the national swimming tournament. Altough I had to stay away
          from the pool because of the COVID-19 for a long time, I am hoping to
          get back to it on coming days.
